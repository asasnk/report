\label{chapter:Introduction}

This chapter presents a very general and broad overview of the current thesis. Firstly, we present how the author thinks about the method at hand, i.e. combination technique \cite{Griebel1992b}. As it happens in every particular area of science, several researchers have basically done similar and closely related works, but they have articulated their methods differently and in result multiple names have been introduced. The name combination technique has been chosen based on the fact that multiple results on different grids have been combined and projected onto one final grid. Secondly, the reason and motivation behind this research will be presented and also marking the benefits of the method in use.\\
Clearly motivation is important only when we are transparent about the objectives and goals of the project. So, we state these goals in detail.
