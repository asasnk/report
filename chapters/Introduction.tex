\label{chapter:Introduction}

This chapter presents a very general and broad overview of the current thesis. Firstly, we present how the author thinks the method at hand, i.e. combination technique, had came to life. As it happens in every particular area of science several researchers have basically done similar and closely related works but they have articulated their methods differently and in result multiple names have been introduced. The author, here, have chosen the name combination technique based on the fact that multiple results on grid have been combined and projected to one final grid.Secondly, the reason and motivation behind this research will be presented in details based on several arguments marking benefits of the method in use.\\
Clearly motivation is important only when we are transparent about the objectives and goals of the project. So, we state these goals in detail.\\
